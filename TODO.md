# TODO

## Must have

* Button on calendar-item: open play page
* Time markers
* Export to ical
* Better colours (and further distinction for colour-blindness)

## Would be nice

* Warn if you select overlapping (or close?) performances
* Button on calendar-item: show popup venue map
* Select two calendar items to show map directions
* Magically compute unique colour from play title
