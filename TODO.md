# TODO

## Must have

* Button on calendar-item: open play page
* Time markers
* Export to ical
* Better colours (and further distinction for colour-blindness)
* Save selected shows and selected perfs to localStorage
* Use Redux
* Better design
  + Apply CSS framework?
  + Put selection in hide-able sidebar
  + Use min-width for calendar so it doesn't get too squashed on small screens (on mobile, have to H-scroll)

## Would be nice

* Export selections to file and import from upload
* Warn if you select overlapping (or close?) performances
* Button on calendar-item: show popup venue map
* Select two calendar items to show map directions
* Magically compute unique colour from play title
* Indicate if a show is sold out (requires backend service constantly updating, or on-demand fetch and crawl from FE code)
* Restrict show times you're interested in
